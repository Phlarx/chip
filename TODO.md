# Todo list
- [x] Write initial version of interpreter
- [x] Write language specification
- [ ] Write documentation for compiler/interpreter/what-cha-ma-call-it
- [ ] Use each element in at least one sample spec
- [ ] Better names/documentation for sample specs
- [ ] Optimize value invalidation for stack control and similar
- [ ] Detangle the mess that is the compiler (i.e. make it not shite)
- [ ] Add multiple levels of verbosity? Perhaps a more detailed printout of internal state?
- [ ] Do some form of testing, besides basic manual tests
- [x] Implement shebang support (i.e. get the compiler to ignore it)
- [ ] Allow stdin to be defined from positional file argument (but not stdout?)
- [x] Add flag for execution without stdin, really only useful with -o or -z
- [ ] Allow arbitrary default values, via --ignore-eof-XX, where XX is 2 digits hexadecimal
- [ ] BUG: empty spec is an error, but because of index error -- clean error, or allow empties
- [ ] Add a delay mechanism? How? Options are read from stack, different delay per side, something else?
