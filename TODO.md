# Todo list
- [x] Write initial version of interpreter
- [x] Write language specification
- [ ] Write documentation for compiler/interpreter/what-cha-ma-call-it
- [ ] Use each element in at least one sample spec
- [ ] Better names/documentation for sample specs
- [ ] Optimize value invalidation for stack control and similar
- [ ] Detangle the mess that is the compiler (i.e. make it not shite)
- [ ] Add multiple levels of verbosity? Perhaps a more detailed printout of internal state?
- [ ] Do some form of testing, besides basic manual tests
- [ ] Implement shebang support (i.e. get the compiler to ignore it)
